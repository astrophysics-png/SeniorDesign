# SeniorDesign
ECE Senior Design project - quantum computing
Notes: 
  - I do not like comsol. It is very clunky
  - To serve as personal and public journal of work and code (as it updates)

	Had to re-request access to engineering move server bc my access expired 
	Loaded most recent design to comsol on HPC, very clunky -> will make edits in move when able 
		tried adjusting the mesh size, will need to work on that more later.

	To-Do: 
	Make mesh size far away from design coarser
		Mesh size near design should get finer as it approaches the design 
	Export data to matlab 
	Do quick mafs to get ion trap depth, height, etc. -> Email prof abt specifics
